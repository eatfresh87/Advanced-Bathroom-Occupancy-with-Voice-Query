# Advanced-Bathroom-Occupancy-with-Voice-Query
"Manages a bathroom light using motion and door sensors. When the room appears to be empty (door closes and motion stops), it asks a question on a media player to confirm occupancy before turning off the light. Requires a configured Voice Assistant and an input_boolean helper."
